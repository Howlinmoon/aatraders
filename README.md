Alien Assault Traders is an online, web-based, turn-based strategy space trading
game forked off the source of both BlackNova Traders (BNT) and Nova Gaming
System (NGS) and inspired by the popular BBS game of TradeWars. Alien Assault
Traders derived from NGS. In playing NGS we felt that the game we wanted to play
was a different direction than what the author of NGS was going. We forked off
NGS and derived the new game that we now call Alien Assault Traders.

Our goal was to create a game that was fast paced, with a high level of variety
and options, very balanced and have a way where with enough strategy, planning
and good team play, any body could be at the top of the rankings.
